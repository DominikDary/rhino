Rhino is a distributed performance testing platform which comprises the Rhino backend platform, 
web UI as well as a collection of libraries and tools which enable developers to write 
performance tests. The tooling around the Rhino platform required for bootstrapping Rhino projects and  
furthermore to create, store and compare performance reports and assessments. 

Rhino does aim to solve following challenges, today we face in existing load testing platform:

* Scheduling without Sharepoint Calendar. 
* Atomisation and setting boundaries of performance testing execution.
* Test isolation.
* Storing and mining performance metrics.
* Reporting and assessment.
* Regression detection.
* Archiving the reports.

Rhino is not a load testing tool, rather a performance assessment platform.
