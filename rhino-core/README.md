Rhino Performance Testing Framework
---

Rhino Performance Testing Framework allows engineers to implement service performance tests in Java 
in JUnit fashion while leveraging the existing performance testing infrastructure within the ACP 
backend as Gatling-based tests do. Java-based tests have the following advantages over the tests 
written with Gatling framework:
 
 * Easy to get started as we all can Java as standard programming language.
 * Easy to **debug** the tests over functional languages implemented for the JVM.
 * Easy to create projects with maven archetypes. 
 * Easy to integrate with existing testing frameworks like Integration Tests.
