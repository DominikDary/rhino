Rhino
---

Rhino is a load and performance testing tool for web services which comprises the Rhino Java 
framework, that can be added as Maven dependency, as well as a collection of libraries and tools 
which enable developers to write load and performance tests.

Rhino's goal: 

* is to speed up load testing development,
* to enable the integration existing Java frameworks, e.g test frameworks to make them reusable 
in load tests,
* to provide an intuitive framework so that the engineers don't need to re-learn the language, 
the framework every time the need to write new load tests which they have already forgotten.

Since we don't write new load tests that often, it is important to have a framework in that 
programming language which we are native and employ it in our projects every day.
