Rhino: Performance Assessment Platform (PAP)
---

Rhino PAP is a load and performance testing tool for web services which comprises the Rhino Java 
framework, that can be added as Maven dependency, as well as a collection of libraries and tools 
which enable developers to write load and performance tests.

Original proposal document: https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/~bagdemir/Rhino%3A+Performance+Assessment+Platform


Rhino's goal: 

* is to speed up load testing development,
* to enable the integration existing Java frameworks, e.g test frameworks to make them reusable 
in load tests,
* to provide an intuitive framework so that the engineers don't need to re-initiate the learning 
process for  the language and the framework every time the need to write new load tests which they 
have already forgotten. Since we don't write new load tests that often, it is important to have a
 framework in that programming language which we are native and employ it in our projects every day.
